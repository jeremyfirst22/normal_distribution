Right now, the gaussian fit uses the max value of the histogram for a. This isn't actually
    the best fit since it overestimates across the whole data. But the peak is in the 
    correct position with the correct shape, so it works for now. 

Use asserts to check values for debugging. See CSE class notes. 

check out GSL and checkout eigen. 

Consider having the program print a png file of the graph (matplotlib, etc) 

Fix single gaussian fit. 

Implement double gaussian fit. 

Other fits?

Implement plot the histogram and fit. 

Implement make check

Verbose output option.
