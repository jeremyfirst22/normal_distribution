Input: String of a filename to read from. 
Purpose: Reads the data from a supplied file name and

Assumptions: Assumes that the file contains only the data, no header or footer.

Output: Returns a vector of doubles containing the data.

Input: A vector of doubles , and the average of the vector.

Input: A 1-D vector of data, and the number of bins in which to bin the elements of the vector.

Assumptions: The number of bins is divided evenly between the minimum and maximum of the data. 
    The histogram is normalized to 1. 
    The maximum of the data, which falls on the boundary of the last bin, is added to the last bin.     That the data and number of bins is sufficiently slow for this operation to happen.

Assumptions: That the input vector is a histogram with already calculated average
